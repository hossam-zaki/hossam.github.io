            Overall, I am interested in the intersection of Computer Science and Biomedicine. I believe that we can advance the fields of biology and medicine using computer science as our avenue. As the world becomes more and more computerized, doctors and researchers cannot fall behind. I am dedicated to use a combination of computer science and biology to make advances in the medical field to hopefully help millions of people around the world
